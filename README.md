Labyrinth game for playing alone or with a friend.

Instructions:

The game has 3 modes of playing: automatic, adventure, and competition.

Choose automatic, if you simply want to see how your machine solves the labyrinth.
Choose adventure if you want to play alone, or choose competition if you want to play with a friend.

If you are playing alone, use the arrow keys to control your avatar. The second player uses keys "w", "a", "s" and "d".
